                I was bored at some point and thought to myself i could make a better note pad than the windows one...<br>i was wrong.<br><br>
                It does have Customisable colors and tabs, but you can't open a file with it from the file explorer, a big downside i tried to fix but in the end gave up on it.<br>
                I might update it eventualy but for now it remains abandoned.</h4>

                <br>I was wrong, all I needed was to be on my summer holdiays.
                <br>This was my first project that i consider complete, sure it might be slow when opening large files that other text editors have no trouble with but i learned a lot from it</p>

                <b>So far you can write some code in a custom css-like language it will render the elements you define.
                <b>It's still a work in progress so its very limited but you could probably use it to make very simple UI.

    <p style="color: #ccc; text-align: center;">Hi! My name is Jonah Hamer and I like to make tools and desktop apps using C#. I began wanting to make games during the covid pandemic, I had already used scratch a few times to make rudimentary games and thought I could do better using a proper game engine. So I downloaded Unity and watched some tutorials and soon enough I had made a game where you had to escape a maze. It wasn't very good but it was good enough to make me keep going.
      <br><br><br>
      After making a few more small games in Unity I watched a tutorial series on programming without a game engine using c# and the console window. After that I barely touched Unity again, the only other thing I made was a game called Teslic Fusion.
      <br><br><br>
      As my knowledge of programming grew I began to understand more and more about C# and programming in general. I was still using only a console window and began to want pixel level control once again. I tried using OpenTK (C# bindings for OpenGL) but found out I was to dumb to use it effectively or even understand half of it.
      <br><br><br>
      Eventually I found Raylib, a simple library with as many bindings as there are atoms in the universe, one of which was C# so i happily started using that and recently released a text editor called My Pad. That is where I stand today, of course there were countless mini projects along the way, many of which stay sitting on my hard drive idly waiting to be opened again.
